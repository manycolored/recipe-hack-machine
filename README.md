All pages have hero image and standard navbar made in Bootstrap. All pages styled with Bootstrap, including cards. 

Index.html has the first three converters. Metric to English converter has script that shows the whole form when the radio button is selected. Form itself runs on a script
that does a lot of math. Farenheit to celsius and back converter and baking time converters also run on mathy scripts. 

I had to include an additional .js on the index page to do some of the math in the metric to english converter. 

Ready Recipes page has a script-based search form that allows looking up recipes. Currently only looks up recipes based on title words. Recipes displayed in a gallery form. 
Script hides most of the article until it the card is clicked. 

Blog also has script-based search form allowing look up by title of blog post. Script hides most of the article until the card is clicked. 

Register/login has a script that corrects user if they try to enter a password that doesn't meet requirements. Working on a way to have the forgot password checkbox 
automatically email the input email with a password reset email but I need a mail server to do that.
