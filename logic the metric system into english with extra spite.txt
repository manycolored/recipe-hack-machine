Are we starting in English or Metric? 
METRIC
Display the metric form. 
Are we converting millilitres?
NO.
Great, we are converting grams. Let's begin. This amount is quantGrams. Here is the math to convert dry grams to teaspoons. This is calcTeaspoons.
Are there 2.5 or more teaspoons? 
NO.
Great, display amount in teaspoons.
YES. 
Fine, divide amount in teaspoons by 2.5. This gives us tablespoons. We will call it calcTablespoons.
Is it 16? 
YES. 
Great, hold that thought. This is calcOneCup. Display amount in cups.
NO. 
Great. We're going to call this calcFractionCups. Well, is it greater than 16? 
NO. 
Divide by 16. The whole number is calcCups.
Is there a modulus? 
NO.
Display calcCups as amount in cups. 
YES. 
We will call the modulus calcCupsModulus. 
Multiply it by 16 to get reCalcTablespoons. 
We need to round. Math.round(reCalcTablespoons); to get roundedReCalcTablespoons.
roundedReCalcTablespoons/16 is a fraction we need to reduce. We will use this function by Phrogz on StackOverflow:

function reduce(reCalcTablespoons,16){
  var gcd = function gcd(a,b){
    return b ? gcd(b, a%b) : a;
  };
  gcd = gcd(numerator,denominator);
  return [numerator/gcd, denominator/gcd];
}

We will call the result numeratorCalcTablespoons and denominatorCalcTablespoons. 
Is denominatorCalcTablespoonsEven? Divide by 2 is there a modulus? 
YES. 
Cool, now we have to go to the display section of the code! 
NO.
Nobody asked those stupid Europeans to start baking like pretend scientists, but here we are. 
Go back to roundedReCalcTablespoons. We know it's odd because otherwise we'd have a measuring cup ready for it. 
So subtract ONE tablespoon. That results in evenedRoundedReCalcTablespoons. 
Put THAT through Phrogz's function. Call THAT result evenedNumeratorCalcTablespoons over evenedDenominatorReCalcTablespoons. 
Take some time to hate yourself for sucking at math, as a treat. 
NOW we have to add 1 to calcTablespoons for the display. Isn't that neat? Go fuck yourself. We still haven't even started with English.
